			<h1>Experiment 7 - Data Visualization & Networks</h1>

				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>	When thinking of data that would be interesting to visualize, I remembered looking up the 
					demographics for my major sometime last year. As a woman in CSGD, I have always felt as though 
					we were underrepresented, and when I looked it up, I wasn't too surprised to learn that women 
					only make up about 20% of CSGD majors. I was able to find the gender split for each major in 
					the 2022-2023 academic year, and used this as a starting point for the experiment. I first 
					started by inputting the gender split in Baskin Engineering into a CSV file. For simplicity, 
					I only included declared majors. After a bit of research, I decided to use Plot for my data 
					visualization purposes, D3's higher-level sister, since I'm not too well-versed in HTML/CSS/JS, 
					and I didn't really need to do anything super outstanding. Plot seemed a lot simpler to use for a beginner. 

				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning how to use Plot within Observable Notebooks (similar to Jupyter Notebooks, but for Plot and D3), 
					I integrated the plot that I made within my own website (seen at the bottom of the page here!)
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Once I was satisfied with the look of the data itself, I wanted to add some interactivity. I added a mouseOver event 
					that shows the gender, major, and percentage of each dot. Finally, I also fixed the overlapping text on the bottom axis, 
					(which for some reason, is not an inherently-included feature) and imported this to my class website.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section"> 
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>It was honestly a huge struggle trying to figure out Plot, to the point that I actually switched back to p5 during 
					the middle of it before realizing that learning Plot would probably be easier than trying to figure out how to 
					display in p5.js. I also spent a lot of time trying to learn how to use Plot. Overall, I'm slightly happy with my result, 
					but I definitely think I could've done more somehow. However, I do really like the subject that I chose, and I think it 
					was interesting to see in a graphical form. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<div id="canvas-container">
					<p>Mouse over the dots to see its major, gender, count, and the percentage of its gender within the major. 
						The total count of the major will be at the top row of each bar, on the rightmost dot.</p>
