			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Methods</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p> For this experiment, I was inspired by YOASOBI, even though they are musical artists. I decided to base my Generative 
					Methods project on one of their music videos, since I have always loved the art and animation in them. 
					After watching several, I finally decided on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzdJkT4kp-A" target="_blank">Halzion</a>, 
					due to the music video's aesthetic.
				</p>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I used both the random() and noise() functions in this experiment. I used noise for the size of the windows,
					so that each window size wouldn't differ too greatly from the last. I used random for many things - 
					the colors picked for each gradient, the position of the windows, and of course, the number of sides for each shape, 
					and the position of each line within the shape.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p> My innovation was the way that I drew the random shapes that appear in each window. For each shape, 
					I chose a random amount of sides that shape would have, 
					and drew that many lines from each shape by choosing a random point for each vertex of the lines. 
					I have never seen anything like this done before, and I think they made really cool scribbly shapes.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this alone, and I am really pleased with the result. I love how it looks, and I
					really enjoyed the process of working on it, and I feel like I have also learned a lot about p5.js
					through the making of this project. It was a bit hard for me to get started and think of an idea at
					first, but once I did, I was able to work almost nonstop until I finished and was satisfied with the
					result.
