			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>	For this experiment, I wanted to play around with using fonts to really make the piece look cohesive. 
					When thinking of some iconic fonts, I instantly thought of Taylor Swift's album folklore. Throughout the 
					branding of the album, from the album's back cover down to the merchandise, all of it used the same font. 
					I was able to easily find the <a href='https://www.dafont.com/im-fell-types.font?text=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'>same font</a> 
					online, and imported it to a p5.js canvas.
				</p>
				<p>I then put some lyrics from the album into a text file, and then displayed it on the canvas. 
					Then, I wanted to have the text fade in and out so that all of the lines would be able to be read. 
					I asked ChatGPT how to do this. It would display one line at a time.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I wanted to have more than just one song available, so I made a bunch of text files with all the songs and lyrics 
					from the albums, and used a random call in the preload() function to randomly choose which song would be played. 
					I also decided to use noise to make the background continuously shift over time. I wanted to give it a feel of a gray haze, 
					which I think I achieved pretty well, and I ended up really liking how the background looked.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>At this point, I was feeling really good with how my project was looking so far, but I was unsure how I could innovate. 
					I decided to start by displaying the song titles along with the songs. Then, I decided to allow a song request system, 
					where the user could type in a song name and have it display the lyrics of that song. If the song name is not a valid name, 
					it will display the lyrics of a random song. To do this, I used the keyPress function in order to keep track of and display 
					the user's inputted text. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this alone. I am pretty happy with the result, and I didn't run into many roadblocks. It was really fun trying 
					to figure out how to use input, how to make objects fade, and how to grab text from a file. Overall, this project was a 
					really fun learning experience and I'm proud of my results.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Type any alphabetical key, space key, or the '1' key. Press enter to change the lyrics to a different song. 
					Type a valid song name from the album 'folklore' by Taylor Swift to change to that song.
				</p>
				<p> Valid song names: the 1, cardigan, the last great american dynasty, exile, my tears ricochet, mirrorball, seven, august, 
					this is me trying, illicit affairs, invisible string, mad woman, epiphany, betty, peace, hoax, the lakes</p>
