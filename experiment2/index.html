			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art, Animation, and Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>Over winter break, I decided to expose myself to more creative coding, to prepare myself
					for the kinds of things I would see in this class. My friend recommended <a href="https://www.instagram.com/etinjcb/" target="_blank">this Instagram account</a>,
					and I completely fell in love with their style. My main inspiration was <a href="https://mastodon.social/@bleuje/111672392290093580" target="_blank">this heart</a>, because I was
					so fascinated by how it looked, and also because I love heart motifs.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>My original inspiration was only animation, but I also wanted to integrate some interactive
					elements into my own project. I really wanted to utilize the mouse position, like I had seen in other
					projects shown in class. I started by connecting lines from each of the dots to the mouse. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>The lines that I connected from the dots to the mouse reminded me of “tugging on heartstrings,”
					so I wanted to play around more with that idea. I also wanted to do more than just one thing 
					with the mouse position. I got the idea to change the color of the heart and the strings
					based on the direction it's pulled, to symbolize how different things can make a heart feel
					differently.
					.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this alone, and I am honestly pleasantly surprised with the result. Even
					though I consulted ChatGPT, I am very proud of my work since it's an idea that came from my
					own mind, and most of my code was my own. I did have some minor setbacks in not being able
					to get the rotation working, and figuring out how to even draw a heart, but after giving myself
					some time away from the project, I was able to complete the project, and I even received
					feedback from my friends on how they enjoy the project and its message.</p>
