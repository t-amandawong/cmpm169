			<h1>Experiment 4 - Images, Video, and Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I was inspired by this <a href="https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1892967">audio visualizer on OpenProcessing</a>
					that was shown during this week's discussion section. I decided to utilize this code to make something similar,
					but with one of my favorite songs, “Beautiful Monster” by STAYC. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>At this point, I had only utilized sound. My initial plan was to have the music video for the song play 
					in the background while the audio visualizer was playing. Unfortunately, the music video playing in the 
					background would often become out-of-sync with the music, due to the video player jumping back a couple 
					of seconds after pausing. So, I decided to pivot to using images instead, since I couldn't get the video 
					to work how I wanted. I masked an image in the shape of a circle in order to make it look like a CD.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Inspired by the record-player examples shown in class, I wanted to make the image spin like a CD.
					To do so, I cut out a smaller hole in the middle of the image, and made the image rotate
					only while the music is playing, to give it a more realistic effect.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this alone, and unfortunately, I am not as pleased with this result as my past experiments. 
					I ran into a lot of roadblocks this time around, creatively and technically, and each time I had to quickly 
					pivot my direction. I was able to create some image and sound art, but I don't feel that it's as creative as 
					my past works.</p>
