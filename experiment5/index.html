				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>In a machine learning class that my partner is taking, they learned about the K-Means algorithm, 
					which is a machine learning algorithm. My partner showed me this visualization of it in 2D -

					K-Means Algorithm Visualization - and I wanted to try and replicate it, but in 3D. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After getting familiar with WebGL, I then decided to implement the K-means algorithm by connecting the spheres and centroids, 
					and having them move to their places. I also made it possible to iterate through steps by pressing the spacebar.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>My code was now displaying K-means properly, but I wanted to add some extra spice to really make it feel 
					like you're stepping through and iterating through the process. I started by making sure that the spheres 
					and centroids start off unconnected. Then, I decided to animate the line movement from the spheres to the centroids, 
					since I felt that it would look smoother than just jarringly switching. Finally, I also displayed text showing the  
					user what iteration they were on. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I worked on this alone. Unfortunately, stress and buildup from other classes caused me to complete this assignment late. 
					While I am still proud of it, I wish I had gotten more time to focus on it rather than on other classes. 
					I think this idea was pretty innovative, since I hadn't tried to model an algorithm before, and it still looks pretty 
					(in my opinion) despite just being a machine learning algorithm.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Click and drag to change perspective, and press the spacebar to iterate through the algorithm.</p>
